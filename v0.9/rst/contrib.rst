Ansible Modules
```````````````

Ansible modules are a way of adding new client-side logic to ansible.
They can be written in any language.

-  `Official "core" ansible modules <http://ansible.cc/docs/modules.html>`_ - various
-  `mercurial <https://github.com/bradobro/ansible-module-mercurial>`_ - bradobro
-  `zypper (bash module example) <https://github.com/jpmens/ansible-zypp>`_ - jp\_mens
-  `homebrew <https://gist.github.com/3170079>`_ - swehack
-  `additional provisioning-related modules <https://github.com/ansible-provisioning>`_ - jhoekx and dagwieers
-  `dynamic dns updates <https://github.com/jpmens/ansible-m-dnsupdate>`_ - jp\_mens

Python modules using 0.6 and later can and should use the common "AnsibleModule"
class to dramatically reduce the amount of boilerplate code required.
Not all modules above yet take advantage of this feature. See the
official documentation for more details.

Selected Playbooks
``````````````````

`Playbooks <http://ansible.cc/docs/playbooks.html>`_ are Ansible's
configuration management language. It should be easy to write your own
from scratch for most applications, but it's always helpful to look at
what others have done for reference.

-  `LAMP <https://github.com/fourkitchens/server-playbooks>`_ - `Four Kitchens <http://fourkitchens.com>`_
-  `Ganglia (demo) <https://github.com/mpdehaan/ansible-examples>`_ - mpdehaan
-  `Nginx <http://www.capsunlock.net/2012/04/ansible-nginx-playbook.html>`_ - cocoy
-  `OpenStack <http://github.com/lorin/openstack-ansible>`_ - lorin

Callbacks and Plugins
`````````````````````

The Ansible project has a whole repo devoted to extending ansible with
new connection types, logging/event callbacks, and inventory data
storage. Talk to Cobbler and EC2, tweak the way things are logged, or
even add sound effects.

-  `Ansible-Plugins <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/plugins>`_

Scripts And Misc
````````````````

Ansible isn't just a program, it's also an API. Here's some examples of
some clever integrations with the "Runner" and also Playbook APIs, and
integrations with other interesting pieces of software.
